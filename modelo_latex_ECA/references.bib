Extensions to PID-achievable performance assessment, trade-off between performance and robustness, and trade-off between deterministic and stochastic performance objectives are discussed. Future directions are pointed out for research and practice with regard to root-cause diagnosis, plant-wide performance assessment, multivariable assessment, adequacy assessment of existing control strategies, performance assessment of model predictive control, and the use of intelligent field devices and artificial intelligence to form a systematic diagnostic methodology. A brief tutorial on performance assessment is given in the appendix with an industrial process example."

	abstract = "Key performance indicators (KPIs) modeling and control is important for efficient design and operation of complex manufacturing production systems. This paper proposes to implement the KPI control based on KPI modeling and stochastic optimization. The KPI relationship is first approximated using ordered block model and pair-copula construction (OBM-PCC) model, which is a non-parametric model that facilitates a flexible surrogate of the KPI relationship. Then, the KPI control is framed into a stochastic optimization problem, where the randomness in the cost function depends on the decision variables. To solve this stochastic optimization problem, the standard uniform distribution is employed to link the OBM-PCC model and the cost function to transform the problem into an ordinary stochastic optimization problem. The proposed method is efficient in KPI control and the performance is robust to the cost function. Extensive numerical studies and comparisons, together with a case study, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed KPI control framework."

	abstract = "Lean PSS (Product-Service System) design comprises a promising strategy for delivering sustainable PSS offerings, considering several well-established lean practices. However, automated ways to apply lean practices and more specifically lean rules in industry are limited. This work proposes a methodology for improving the leanness of PSS design, by combining real-time KPI monitoring with lean principles and practices. Through a correlation of typical wastes with the metrics used in the calculation of KPIs, the Total Leanness Index (TLI) of the procedures is defined. Based on automatically identified trade-off values for TLI, lean rules are extracted to improve the performance of PSS lifecycle phases. The proposed lean rules extraction methodology (LeanREM) is validated through a case study of power waste reduction and the concurrently maintenance time decrease in a mould-making company."
